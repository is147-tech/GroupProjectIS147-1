## The Topic

Many college students struggle with managing their finances due to irregular incomes, unexpected expenses, erratic spending, and a lack of financial literacy. Being financially smart comes with several key benefits, avoids constant worry about money, debt, and unexpected expenses, ensures essential expenses are covered first, reduces reliance on credit cards and loans by managing expenses properly, and encourages responsible spending and saving habits for long-term stability.

#### Our Focus: 
The issue is really clear, many young adults are going into the real world with a lot of needs, and little knowledge of to reach their goals and still set a postive path for their future. Credit Card companies understand the vulnerabilities of these students who are sometimes desperate for money and don't read between the lines of what comes with it, like high APRS. 

[From a study](https://www.cardrates.com/news/student-credit-card-debt-statistics/)
"In a 2023 survey of U.S. undergraduate students, 42.1% reported having credit card debt, down from 46.1% the previous year" and "Among current college students surveyed in 2019, only 20% reported having excellent money management skills. Two-fifths (40%) considered their skills average, not very good, or poor." 

#### Our plan: 
To address this issue, our team, Bit by Bit Finaacial Help is developing a Finance Tracker, which will be a user friendly tool designed specifically for students to track expenses, set budgets, monitor savings, simulating events of the real world to promote smart finacial decisions and gain insights into their financial habits. By providing an easy-to-use financial management solution, our project aims to help students develop responsible financial habits, reduce stress about money, and make smarter spending decisions during college and beyond. 

TASK 5
This project utilizes JavaDoc to generate organized documentation for all public classes, methods, and fields in the codebase, thereby improving readability and serving as the official documentation of the project.

JavaDoc is a tool provided by the JDK that allows developers to embed documentation directly into the source code using special comment tags. The comments are compiled into navigable HTML pages that explain the structure and functionality of the code.
